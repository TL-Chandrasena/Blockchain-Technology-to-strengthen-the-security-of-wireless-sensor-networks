# Blockchain-Technology-to-strengthen-the-security-of-wireless-sensor-networks

📌 Overview

This project integrates Blockchain Technology with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to enhance data security and integrity. WSNs are widely used in real-time applications such as traffic monitoring, patient health tracking, and environmental sensing. However, storing data on a centralized server makes it vulnerable to alterations and cyber threats. This project leverages Blockchain’s decentralized nature to store and verify sensor data securely, preventing unauthorized modifications.

🏆 Objectives

Implement Blockchain-based decentralized data storage for WSNs.
Strengthen data security by verifying sensor data integrity.
Minimize risks associated with centralized data storage vulnerabilities.
Use Python, Flask, and Web3 to develop a secure and scalable system.

🚀 Features

✔ Blockchain Integration: Secure storage of sensor data using a decentralized approach.
✔ WSN Simulation: IoT sensors generate real-time temperature data and store it on the Blockchain.
✔ Tamper Detection: Any attempt to modify data results in hash mismatches, ensuring data integrity.
✔ User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login for authorized users.
✔ Data Visualization: Real-time tracking of sensor data using Flask & Web3.
✔ Smart Contracts: Implemented on Ethereum Blockchain for immutable and transparent transactions.

🔬 Results & Key Findings

📌 Tamper-Proof Storage: Unauthorized modifications are instantly detected.
📌 Decentralized Network: Eliminates single-point failure risks.
📌 Secure Data Integrity: Ensures verifiable and immutable sensor logs.
📌 Performance Analysis: Efficient transaction processing with minimal latency.
